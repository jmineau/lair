# Changelog

All notable changes to lair are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions
are calendar-based (`YYYY.MM.PATCH`, with `MM` = 05, 08 or 12). Releases up to
2026.12.7 are described in their
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jmineau/lair/releases).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- lair ships `py.typed`, so type checkers read its annotations.
- The documentation has a version dropdown. The site opens at the latest
  release, `dev/` follows `main`, and each release keeps its own pages.

### Changed

- Python 3.11 or newer is required, and `typing-extensions` is no longer a
  dependency (breaking).
