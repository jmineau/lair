Welcome to LAIR's documentation!
================================

:code:`lair` is a collection of tools that I have developed/acquired for my
research regarding land-air interactions. I spent a lot of time developing
the :code:`uataq` subpackage which provides a simple interface for reading
in data from the Utah Atmospheric Trace Gas and Air Quality (UATAQ)
project - the idea being that we as scientists spend too much time on data
wrangling and not enough time on analysis. The :code:`lair` package is designed
to make it easier to work with atmospheric data, particularly data from the
UATAQ project.

Installation
============

The ``lair`` package is installable from the git repository via ``pip``, however, some dependencies can only be installed via ``conda``.
Additionally, many components of ``lair`` require access to CHPC which encourages the use of ``conda``. Therefore, we recommend using ``conda`` to install the package.

.. important::

   If you are using CHPC, it is assumed that ``miniforge3`` is installed following the instructions at https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/software/python-anaconda.php

To create a new conda environment for ``lair``, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   mamba create -n lair -c conda-forge python=3.10 esmpy

If you already have a conda environment, simply install the dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   mamba activate <lair-env>
   mamba install -c conda-forge esmpy

.. note::

   ``lair`` requires Python 3.10 or higher.

Now we can install the package via ``pip``. Either directly from the git repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/jmineau/lair.git

or by cloning the repository and installing it as an editable package:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/jmineau/lair.git
   cd lair
   pip install -e .

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

``lair`` is a rather dependecy-heavy package, however, many are common in the field of atmospheric science. To keep ``lair`` as lightweight as possible, some dependencies related to meteorology are currently optional. These include:

- ``boto3``
- ``metpy``
- ``s3fs``
- ``siphon``
- ``synopticpy``
- ``zarr``

The following modules are impacted:

- ``lair.air.hrrr``
- ``lair.air.soundings``

To install the optional dependencies, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   # via conda (preferred on CHPC)
   conda activate <lair-env>  # activate your lair environment
   conda install -c conda-forge boto3 metpy s3fs siphon synopticpy zarr

   # via pip
   pip install git+https://github.com/jmineau/lair.git[met]

Verbosity
=========

Verbosity for the ``lair`` package is set via ``lair.config.verbose`` as a boolean.

For early versions of the package, ``verbose`` will be set to ``True`` by default. This will be changed in future versions.
